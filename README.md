üåê **Live Demo**: [EasyRent Website](https://easy-rent-ashy.vercel.app/home) (Backend goes to sleep after ~15 minutes of no visits so please give it time to load)

## Project Overview

EasyRent is a web application designed to streamline the car rental process for users by offering a seamless platform where customers can browse available cars, filter them based on various parameters, and book vehicles using external payment services or an integrated virtual wallet. The application allows for multiple roles, where users, vehicle owners, and administrators interact and collaborate efficiently to create a personalized and effective car rental experience.

### Motivation

This project is the result of teamwork developed as part of the course assignment for [Software Engineering](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/predmet/proinz) at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb. The primary goal of EasyRent is to simplify car rental operations in the tourism and business sectors, enabling users to quickly and easily book vehicles online. The platform optimizes the business processes for companies dealing with car rentals and is scalable to meet the needs of different users and businesses. This project provided an opportunity for the team to learn about cutting-edge technologies, including **frontend and backend development, database management, DevOps practices, and security implementation through OAuth 2.0**. 


### Problem We Are Solving

In an era of digital transformation, traditional car rental processes are often inefficient, involving manual processes, multiple interactions, and unclear communication. EasyRent solves this problem by offering:
- A centralized platform to view and book vehicles.
- Communication tools for direct interaction between users and car owners.
- A secure and transparent review system to ensure trust between users and owners.
- Integrated payment solutions to simplify transactions.

By addressing these challenges, EasyRent enhances both the customer and car owner experience, making the process quicker, easier, and more transparent.
